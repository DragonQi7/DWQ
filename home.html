        The Blue Moon is a special and rare full moon that usually occurs once every two to three years. It doesn't have a traditional name like the others, but it's often considered the "extra" moon in a season that has four full moons instead of the usual three.
Because of its rarity and its connection to the color blue, it's often associated with the element Water. Water represents depth, mystery, and the subconscious, which is why the Blue Moon is often seen as the deepest or most introspective of all the moons. Join us and connect to a nourishing, deeply healing experience.
