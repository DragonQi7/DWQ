        <div class="about-content">
            <p>The Dragon's Way Qigong system is a classical approach to energy cultivation based on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).</p>
            <p>Developed by Grand Master Nan Lu, this practice teaches that health and transformation begin from within—when we align with the laws of nature and the rhythm of the universe.</p>
            <p>Through gentle yet powerful movements, food therapy, and energy awareness, practitioners learn to release stagnant emotions, awaken their body's natural wisdom, and reconnect to the flow of Qi.</p>
            <p><strong>It's not exercise—it's a return to balance.</strong></p>
